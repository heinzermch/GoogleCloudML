# GoogleCloudML
This repository contains different examples of ML architectures which run on GoogleCloudML. Especially the files 4 to 6 contain examples to run different deep learing architectures in the cloud. The bigger ones have been adapted to run on a single GPU model, which had an 11 GB RAM limit (as of July 2017).
